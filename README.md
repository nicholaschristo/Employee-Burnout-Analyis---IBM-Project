# Employee-Burnout-Analyis---IBM-Project
As part of my internship with Edunet and IBM, I analyzed employee burnout using data analytics and machine learning. I collected and preprocessed data, built predictive models, and created visualizations to identify burnout patterns. Recommendations included wellness programs and work-life balance initiatives.
